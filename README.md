sandbox run js in ctxï¼Œrunning so far so good.  

Challenge still accepted!  If you have escape case, **just show me the code** at the issues(https://github.com/wanjo-tech/vm2/issues/4), I'll investigate and fix ASAP.

## Code

## Test

https://github.com/wanjo-tech/vm2/blob/main/test.js

## Article

## Used-by

* I use jevalx() in my [kk project](https://github.com/wanjo-tech/kk)

## Container

Even the codes are proven-of-concepts and running fine, we still recommend building the production and public-accessible application run inside docker with removing danger modules such as process and fs in global scope.
